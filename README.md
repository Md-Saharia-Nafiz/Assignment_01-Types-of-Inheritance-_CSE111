This assignment explores different types of inheritance in C++ and their key features, showing how base and derived classes interact to promote code reusability and modular programming.


## Description:

Inheritance in C++: 
Inheritance is a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to acquire properties and functions from another class. It promotes code reusability and makes programs more organized and manageable. The class that provides features is called the base class, and the class that inherits them is called the derived class. Derived classes can use the public and protected members of the base class. There are different types of inheritance: single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid. Inheritance helps model real-world relationships and keeps code modular.
## Types of Inheritance in C++ :

1. Single Inheritance

* One derived class inherits from one base class.

* Simple and easy to manage.

2. Multiple Inheritance

* One derived class inherits from more than one base class.

* Can lead to ambiguity, solved using virtual inheritance.

3. Multilevel Inheritance

* A class is derived from a derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.

* Models hierarchical relationships.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance

* Combination of two or more types of inheritance.

* Can be complex, often uses virtual inheritance to avoid duplication.
## 💡 Key Concepts Used in All Types of Inheritance:

(i) Base Class / Parent Class – The class whose properties and methods are inherited.

(ii) Derived Class / Child Class – The class that inherits properties and methods from the base class.

(iii) Access Specifiers – public, protected, and private control inheritance behavior.

(iv) Code Reusability – Enables using existing code without rewriting.

(v) Function Overriding – Derived class can modify base class methods.

(vi) Virtual Inheritance – Avoids ambiguity in multiple and hybrid inheritance.

(vii) Polymorphism – Works with inheritance to allow dynamic method behavior.

(viii) Encapsulation – Base class members can remain protected/private while still accessible via derived classes appropriately.
## ✨ Features of All Types of Inheritance:

✅ Code Reusability – Inheritance allows derived classes to use base class code without rewriting it.

✅Hierarchy Representation – Models real-world relationships between classes.

✅Access Control – Inherited members follow public, protected, and private rules.

✅Function Overriding – Derived classes can modify or extend base class methods.

✅Polymorphism Support – Enables dynamic method behavior using base class pointers or references.

✅Modularity – Makes programs structured and easier to maintain.

✅Virtual Inheritance (if needed) – Avoids duplication and ambiguity in multiple/hybrid inheritance.
## 🔔 Purpose of Inheritance in C++:

Inheritance allows a class to reuse code from another class. It helps in creating a hierarchical classification of classes. Promotes modularity by organizing programs into base and derived classes. Enables function overriding, allowing derived classes to customize behavior. Supports polymorphism for dynamic method execution. Reduces redundancy and makes maintenance easier. Models real-world relationships between entities in a program.
